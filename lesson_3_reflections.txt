When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When i work remotely, and work from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- you may not want to pull all changes you made on the remote repository - if you are working on some other enhancement in parallel, or do not require the changes made on the remote repository just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- Forks - to "copy" a repository on GitHub itself, from another user to yours.
  clones - to "copy" a repository from GitHub to your local machine as Origin.
  branches - to make another version of a committed version of your code, and work on it in parallel, leaving the copied version as it is.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- it is beneficial sometimes when you need a copy of the latest changes on GitHub, into your local, but not merging to the latest branch you have - specially when you want to go offline and need time to review the new changes on the GitHub, before merging into your latest code.
