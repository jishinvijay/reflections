When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When i work remotely, and work from multiple machines.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- you may not want to pull all changes you made on the remote repository - if you are working on some other enhancement in parallel, or do not require the changes made on the remote repository just yet.
